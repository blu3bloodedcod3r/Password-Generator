# Password Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project was to make prompts for the user to generate a password using special characters, numbers and lowercaes/uppercase letters.
- I built this project because generating passwords can be useful.
- This solves the problem of having to make a password and the computer making one for you.
- What did you learn? I learned that there are many ways to generate a password with differentiating prompts and alerts.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
