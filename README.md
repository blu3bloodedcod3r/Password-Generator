# Password Generator

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to make prompts for the user to generate a password using special characters, numbers and lowercaes/uppercase letters.
- I built this project because generating passwords can be useful.
- This solves the problem of having to make a password and the computer making one for you.
- What did you learn? I learned that there are many ways to generate a password with differentiating prompts and alerts.
